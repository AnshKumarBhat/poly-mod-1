# poly-mod-1


## Project Overview

This project aims to guide you through the process of creating, deploying, and bridging an NFT collection. The steps include:

1. **Creating NFT Images**: Using AI tools like DALLE 2 or Midjourney to generate unique images for your NFT collection.
2. **Deploying on Ethereum**: Deploying your NFT collection on the Ethereum blockchain.
3. **Mapping to Polygon**: Mapping the deployed collection to the Polygon network.
4. **Transferring Assets**: Transferring the NFTs from Ethereum to Polygon using the Polygon Bridge.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A working knowledge of blockchain technology, Ethereum, and NFTs.
- Basic familiarity with smart contract development.
- Accounts on Ethereum and Polygon.
- Access to image generation tools like DALLE 2 or Midjourney.
- Metamask or another web3 wallet.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Generate NFT Images

1. **Sign Up/Access DALLE 2 or Midjourney**:
   - Create an account on [DALLE 2](https://www.openai.com/dalle-2/) or [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/).

2. **Create Your Images**:
   - Use the image generation tool to create unique images for your NFT collection. Save these images locally.

### Step 2: Deploy NFTs on Ethereum

1. **Setup Your Development Environment**:
   - Install Node.js and npm.
   - Install Hardhat or Truffle for smart contract development.

2. **Write Your Smart Contract**:
   - Develop a smart contract for your NFTs using the ERC-721 standard. You can use the OpenZeppelin library to simplify this process.

3. **Compile and Deploy**:
   - Compile your smart contract using Hardhat or Truffle.
   - Deploy your smart contract to the Ethereum testnet (Rinkeby or Ropsten) first, and then to the mainnet.

4. **Mint Your NFTs**:
   - Use a script to mint the NFTs with the images you generated earlier.

### Step 3: Map to Polygon

1. **Setup Polygon SDK**:
   - Follow the [Polygon SDK documentation](https://polygon.technology/developers) to set up your environment.

2. **Map Your Collection**:
   - Use the Polygon SDK to map your Ethereum-deployed NFT collection to the Polygon network.

### Step 4: Transfer Assets via Polygon Bridge

1. **Access Polygon Bridge**:
   - Go to the [Polygon Bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge).

2. **Transfer NFTs**:
   - Connect your wallet and follow the prompts to transfer your NFTs from Ethereum to Polygon.

## Additional Resources

- [Ethereum Documentation](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/)
- [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/)
- [Polygon Documentation](https://polygon.technology/developers/)
- [DALLE 2](https://www.openai.com/dalle-2/)
- [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/)

## Troubleshooting

- **Deployment Issues**: Ensure your smart contract is correctly written and all dependencies are installed.
- **Mapping Issues**: Verify your contract address and network configurations.
- **Transfer Issues**: Check the Polygon Bridge documentation and ensure you have sufficient funds for gas fees.
